# Kata Pencil Durability
"Kata Pencil Durability" is a mini coding project to show the people at Pillar Technologies my programming abilities.

### What is this impeccable directory full of code?
Specifications for this project can be found on their [GitHub](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability) but essentially this project is meant to be a command line simulation of using a pencil and paper. Text can be written to the paper, erased, and edited according to specifications but pencils also break, can be resharpened, and erasers erode.
One twist on the project as they gave it to me is that I made it possible to have multiple Papers and multiple Pencils at a time.

### Where is most up-to-date version of this magnificent program?
This project, as I have been working on it, can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/jsogard/kata-pencil-durability).

### How do I make it do the wonderful things it does?
In order to execute this project all you have to do is execute **_kata.bat_** in its respective directory. (At least on Windows, I know you guys have Macs...)
If, for whatever reason, **_kata.bat_** does not work, navigate to the root directory and execute:
```
java -jar kata-pencil-durability.jar
```
If that doesn't work idk maybe Java is broken or not in your path or something... I guess you could email me?

### Who is the glorious programmer that made this?
Just me, it's no biggie. Oh oops, looks like I accidentally dropped my resume in this folder! Silly me...
