# Kata Pencil Durability
"Kata Pencil Durability" is a mini coding project to show the people at Pillar Technologies my programming abilities.

### What is this impeccable directory full of code?
Specifications for this project can be found on their [GitHub](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability) but essentially this project is meant to be a command line simulation of using a pencil and paper. Text can be written to the paper, erased, and edited according to specifications but pencils also break, can be resharpened, and erasers erode.
One twist on the project as they gave it to me is that I made it possible to have multiple Papers and multiple Pencils at a time.

### Where is most up-to-date version of this magnificent program?
This project, as I have been working on it, can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/jsogard/kata-pencil-durability).

### How do I make it do the wonderful things it does?
This is a Maven project, so make sure you have all that is necessary to work with Maven.
In order to run just the tests I've created in this project, execute:
```
mvn test
```
To build the project, execute:
```
mvn clean package
```
and it should tell you where the jar it created is.
I'm not super familiar with Maven, so if there are problems, just let me know. I porbably just screwed up the gitignore or something.
