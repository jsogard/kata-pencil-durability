# Kata Pencil Durability
"Kata Pencil Durability" is a mini coding project to show the people at Pillar Technologies my programming abilities.

### What is it?
Specifications for this project can be found on their [GitHub](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability) but essentially this project is meant to be a command line simulation of using a pencil and paper. Text can be written to the paper, erased, and edited according to specifications but pencils also break, can be resharpened, and erasers erode.

### Where is it?
This project, as I have been working on it, can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/jsogard/kata-pencil-durability).

### How do I make it do things?
In order to execute this project all you have to do is execute **_kata.bat_** in its respective directory. (At least on Windows, I know you guys have Macs...)
If, for whatever reason, **_kata.bat_** does not work, navigate to the root directory and execute:
```
java -jar kata-pencil-durability.jar
```
If that doesn't work idk maybe Java is broken or not in your path or something... I guess you could email me?

### Who are you?
Oh oops, looks like I accidentally dropped my resume in this folder! Silly me
